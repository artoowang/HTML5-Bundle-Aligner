Javascript + HTML5 canvas map alignment tool for bundle files.

There are several pieces:

1. PHP code for loading bundle files into javascript
2. Javascript Canvas alignment code
3. Mechanical turk bits in the PHP code (this is an example of an external hit)
4. Mturk command line code for launching these jobs as external hits

This code adapted from: http://adamsmith.as/typ0/k/canvas.html
