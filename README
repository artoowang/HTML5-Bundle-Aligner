Javascript + HTML5 canvas map alignment tool for bundle files.

There are several pieces:

1. PHP code for loading bundle files into javascript
2. Javascript Canvas alignment code
3. Mechanical turk bits in the PHP code (this is an example of an external hit)
4. Mturk command line code for launching these jobs as external hits


The basic alignment code adapted from: http://adamsmith.as/typ0/k/canvas.html

Here's the link to the amazon mturk command line tools I used: http://aws.amazon.com/developertools/Amazon-Mechanical-Turk/694

I wrote a blog post about some external hit stuff I just figured out: http://kaflurbaleen.blogspot.com/2012/05/in-which-i-battle-mturk-external-hits.html

You should realize that the "bundle id" thing has to do with PhotoCity seeds and you'll need to have that json_encode_bundle.php file read them from a more appropriate place.
